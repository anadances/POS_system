This is a simple Point of Sale system built in Ruby with Active Record as part of
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

To start the app, run `ruby bin/pos.rb`.

Enjoy!
